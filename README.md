# 🎮 Rock – Paper – Scissors Game

A simple and interactive **Rock–Paper–Scissors game** built using  
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user plays against the computer and
the winner is decided based on standard RPS rules.

This project helped me practice DOM manipulation and game logic in JavaScript.
